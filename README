Utility for launching synchronized system resource monitors across an array of unix machines.

Required:

 - Ruby 1.9.2 on host you are launching monitors from
   - If you want to use the graphing option for parse_stat_logs.rb you'll need the following:
     - Gem: rmagick (2.13.1+)
     - Gem: gruff (0.3.6+)
     - imagemagick (6.7.1+)
 - perl 5+ on hosts you are monitoring
 - ssh with no auth (use public/private ssh key match)

Setup:

1. Copy perl monitor scripts to all hosts you wish to monitor. By default sys_stat_monitors expects them to be in $HOME/bin for the unix user you specify in the yaml config

NOTE: If you are using db_conn-mon.plx or :db trigger in your monitoring, you'll need to make sure the user you are ssh'ing in as has all the proper environment variables needed to run sqlplus. You can make sure of that by adding those keys in the user's .ssh/environment file and making sure 'PermitUserEnvironment' is set to yes in sshd_config

2. Copy config/monitor_config.yaml.template to config/monitor_config.yaml and modify with your environment settings

Execution:

sys_stat_monitors.rb is the script that launches the monitors across your network.

Usage: sys_stat_monitors.rb [OPTIONS]
    -h, --help                       Display help screen
    -c, --config FILE                path to yaml config file (MANDATORY)
    -l, --log FILE                   path to log output
    -d, --debug                      enable debug logging
    -p, --path                       path to monitoring commands

parse_stat_logs.rb is a utility to parse the logs and extract the relevant data.

Usage: parse_stat_logs.rb [OPTIONS]
    -h, --help                       Display help screen
    -n, --net FILE                   path to net stat file
    -d, --db FILE                    path to db stat file
    -g, --graph                      generate graphs
