Utility for launching synchronized system resource monitors across an array of unix machines.

Required:

 - Ruby 1.9.2 on host you are launching monitors from
 - perl 5+ on hosts you are monitoring
 - ssh with no auth (use public/private ssh key match)

Setup:

1. Copy perl monitor scripts to all hosts you wish to monitor. By default sys_stat_monitors expects them to be in $HOME/bin for the unix user you specify in the yaml config

2. Copy config/monitor_config.yaml.template to config/monitor_config.yaml and modify with your environment settings

Usage: sys_stat_monitors.rb [OPTIONS]
    -h, --help                       Display help screen
    -c, --config FILE                path to yaml config file (MANDATORY)
    -l, --log FILE                   path to log output
    -d, --debug                      enable debug logging
    -p, --path                       path to monitoring commands
